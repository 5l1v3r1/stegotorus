Welcome to StegoTorus by SRI International (http://www.sri.com)

== What is this? ==

Please see "StegoTorus: A Camouflage Proxy for the Tor Anonymity System"
for a detailed explanation on what this tool does and how it does it.

== Compilation ==

Prepare the raw git repository first and generate configure and Makefile:
{{{
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-silent-rules
}}}

To compile manually:
{{{
make
}}}

=== Debian ===

To make a Debian package:
{{{
make deb
}}}

This will likely ask for various packages to be installed that are needed for compilation.

=== Mac OS X ===

Install homebrew (if you do not have it yet):

{{{
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
}}}

install dependencies:
{{{
brew install autoconf automake cmake docbook jansson libevent libtool openssl pkg-config readline tor
}}}

Compile StegoTorus:
{{{
cd stegotorus
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-silent-rules libcrypto_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include libcrypto_LIBS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/ -lssl -lcrypto" libz_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/ libz_LIBS="-L/usr/lib -lz" libjansson_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/jansson/include CFLAGS=-Wno-format-nonliteral
make
}}}

Note that on OSX10.9 libz is new enough, hence why we point it there, we disable -Wno-format-nonliteralmake as we have code that does this, might want to properly solve this by adding the relevant pragmas that indicate that these strings need format checking though.

=== Windows ===

Cross-compilation happens from a Debian/Ubuntu host.

Just run:
{{{
./cross-compile
}}}

and all should get arranged. This fetches and uses MXE for cross-compilation.
