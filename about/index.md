We have a few papers:

  * The original paper describing StegoTorus is *StegoTorus: A Camouflage Proxy for the Tor Anonymity System* and can be found [here](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/stegotorus/blob/master/doc/stegotorus.pdf?raw=true).

  * One of the steganographic engines is based on JPEG images.  Refer to the paper *TRIST: Circumventing Censorship with Transcoding-Resistant Image Steganography* [here](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/jel/blob/master/doc/jpegsteg.pdf?raw=true).
