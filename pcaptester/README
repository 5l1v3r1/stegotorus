PCAPTESTER  (so far tested only on mac and ubuntu)


It downloads a large file (200K) using stegotorus on the loopback interface,
captures packets using tcpdump  and  runs validation scripts against 
generated cover files.   For longer runs just change the command line
parameter for fake-server.csh in pcaptester.csh

pcaptester/fake-server.csh <FILESIZE_IN_BYTES> |nc -l 1234 &  



On mac:

install bro, base64, perl, and js (i.e., SpiderMonkey's JavaScript Shell),
and make sure user has permission to run tcpdump

On ubuntu:

install bro, ipfw, perl, and js,
and make sure user has permission to run tcpdump
ipfw is used to slow down the link so tcpdump can capture packets without
loss.  However, on ubuntu this doesn't seem to work so well, i.e., we still
lose some packets and are unable to reassemble all files on the wire.



to run:

type pcaptester/pcaptester.csh from the top directory

pcaptester/files (all cover files used in this stegotorus run)
