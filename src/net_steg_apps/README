README for ns_app_echo

------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
ns_app_echo is an example application that illustrates
how one may use the steganography capabilities of StegoTorus.
In this application, the client will send an 80-byte message
to the server, and the server will send back the same message
back to the client, both using StegoTorus's HTTP steganography module.


------------------------------------------------------------
Testing platform and procedure:
This application was tested on a machine running Mac OS X 10.8.4.
Moreover, the Makefile assumes that the net_steg_apps directory
lives in the source directory of StegoTorus.

To test ns_app_echo, perform the following steps:
1) Adjust the paths in Makefile (e.g., pkgdir, pkgincludedir, pkglibdir)
2) Run make
3) Start the server by running 
   ./ns_app_echo server 127.0.0.1:8080
4) Wait until the server completes its initialization (as indicated
   by the message "server ready to receive data")
5) Start the client (in another window) by running
   ./ns_app_echo client 127.0.0.1:8080 


------------------------------------------------------------
Example output:
Both the server and the client will display the message sent by
the other party, which contains 80 A's.
